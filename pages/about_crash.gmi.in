# Oops

It seems that Telescope crashed last time!  Please consider reporting this bug so it can be fixed.

=> mailto:@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@	@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@

When reporting a bug, please include the following information, otherwise it won’t be very helpful:

* Operating system
* Telescope version (i.e. @PACKAGE_STRING@)
* how to reproduce the crash, if known

If possible, a backtrace (the state of the program when it crashed) should be included too, as it contains invaluable data to understand the source of the bug.  Obtaining a backtrace is usually simple, but the exact procedure depends on the operating system.

On most system, after a crash a file named ‘telescope.core’ or ‘<number>.core’ or just ‘core’ should appear in the directory where Telescope was launched (probably your home).

The shell may have to be configured to allow coredumps.  Running

> $ ulimits -c unlimited

should enable core dump for the current session on most shells.

Once the core dump is located, a backtrace may be obtained with the aid of a debugger, like ‘gdb’ (the GNU debugger) or ‘lldb’ (the LLVM debugger):

> $ gdb telescope path/to/core-file

On a linux distro with systemd (Arch, Fedora, Debian, ...) ‘coredumpctl’ may be needed to launch the debugger.  Please refer to the following Arch wiki page:

=> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump

in particular the “Examining a core dump” section.

At this point you should be at the GDB prompt.  Just type ‘bt’, press enter and copy all the output in a mail to @PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@.

> (gdb) bt
> ...lots of useful information...
> (gdb)

To quit gdb, just type ‘q’ and enter.

Thank you!
