# Oops

It seems that Telescope crashed last time!  Please consider reporting this bug so it can be fixed.

=> mailto:@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@	@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@

When reporting a bug, its useful to include the following information, otherwise it won’t be helpful:

* Operating system
* Telescope version (i.e. @PACKAGE_STRING@)
* how to reproduce the crash, if known

In addition, the backtrace (i.e. the state of the program at the moment of the crash) contains invaluable data to unveil the source of the bug.  Obtaining a backtrace is usually simple, but unfortunately depends on your system.

On most system, you should find a file named ‘telescope.core’ or ‘<number>.core’ or just ‘core’ in the directory where you launched telescope (probably your home).

Your shell may be configured to disallow coredumps.  If

> $ ulimit -c

prints 0 then you’ll need to enable coredumps using

> $ ulimits -c unlimited

and try to reproduce the bug again.

To open a core file you need to install ‘gdb’ (the GNU debugger) and type

> $ gdb telescope path/to/core-file

If you’re using a linux distro with systemd (Arch, Fedora, Debian, ...) you have to use coredumpctl to obtain a backtrace.  Please refer to the following page on the Arch wiki:

> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump

in particular the “Examining a core dump” section.

At this point you should be at the GDB prompt.  Just type ‘bt’, press enter and copy all the output in a mail to @PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@.

> (gdb) bt
> ...prints lots of useful information...
> (gdb)

To quit gdb, just type ‘q’ and enter.

Thanks!
